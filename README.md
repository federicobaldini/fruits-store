# fruits-store

Demo project of a web application to add, delete and search fruits, using Vue and TypeScript. I made this project to practice Vue's composition API in preparation for my technical interview with Gamindo.

## Available Scripts

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

then start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Building

To create an optimised version of the app:

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles the application in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
